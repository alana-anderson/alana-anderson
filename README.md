### Hi, I'm @alana-anderson
:metal: __XP__: 13+ yrs Engineering & Leadership 

:gem: __Role__: Director of Engineering

:magic_wand: __Class__: Druid Support

I create environments that inspire radical candor, psychological safety, and innovation while allowing individuals and teams to thrive
whether on-site or distributed (mainly distributed now :P).

#### Things I obsess over:
- Solution Architecture
- Software Development & Process
- Analytics & Metric Analysis
- Coaching & Mentorship
- Technical & Capacity Planning
- Javascript (the good, the bad, the ugly)
